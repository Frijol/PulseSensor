PulseSensor
===========

The [PulseSensor](pulsesensor.com) is an open source pulse sensor.

Connect the PulseSensor as follows:

1. Black wire to GND (there's one on the GPIO port)
1. Red wire to 5V (Vin on the GPIO port)
1. Purple wire (signal) to one of the Analog pins on the GPIO port. I use A1.
